Performance Bottleneck Analysis for cvv

Critical Bottlenecks Identified

1. ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: GIL Contention in Multi-Threading

Location: src/cvv/main.py:547-553 (writer threads), 562-594 (main read loop)

Issue: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound operations.

# Current: Python threading with GIL contention
thread = threading.Thread(target=self._writer_thread, ...)

Impact:
- Writer threads compete for GIL when calling f.write(chunk) (line 665)
- Hash computation (hasher.update(chunk) line 569) holds GIL
- Multiple threads context-switching creates overhead
- Estimated throughput loss: 30-50% on multi-destination copies

Evidence:
- With 3 destinations, you're doing: 1 read + 3 writes + hashing = 5 GIL-contending operations
- Each f.write() acquires GIL even though I/O should be async

2. ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE: Synchronous Queue Operations with Timeout

Location: src/cvv/main.py:574-583

Issue: Blocking queue operations with busy-wait loops

for q in chunk_queues:
    while not self._abort_event.is_set():
        try:
            q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # 100ms timeout per queue!
            break
        except queue.Full:
            continue  # Busy wait

Impact:
- If Queue 1 is full, we wait 100ms before retry
- Must fill ALL queues sequentially before reading next chunk
- With 3 destinations, worst case: 300ms delay per chunk
- Estimated throughput loss: 10-20% under queue contention

Math: At 8MB chunks, 100ms timeout = max 80 MB/s per destination

---
3. ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE: Writer Thread Polling Loop

Location: src/cvv/main.py:654-659

Issue: Writer threads busy-wait with 100ms timeout

try:
    chunk = chunk_queue.get(timeout=0.1)  # Wake up every 100ms
except queue.Empty:
    if self._abort_event.is_set():
        return
    continue  # Busy wait loop

Impact:
- Each writer wakes up 10 times/second even when idle
- CPU cycles wasted on context switching
- Estimated CPU overhead: 5-10%

---
4. ðŸŸ¢ MINOR: Unbuffered File I/O

Location: src/cvv/main.py:650

Issue: Default buffering may not be optimal

with open(temp_path, mode) as f:  # Uses default buffer (8KB typically)
    f.write(chunk)  # 8MB chunks, but small internal buffer

Impact:
- Python's default buffer (8KB) is tiny compared to 8MB chunks
- Multiple system calls per write
- Estimated throughput loss: 5-10%

Fix: Use buffering=-1 or explicit large buffer

---
5. ðŸŸ¢ MINOR: Progress Throttling Overhead

Location: src/cvv/main.py:586-589

Issue: Time check on every chunk iteration

current_time = time.time()  # System call
if current_time - last_progress_time >= progress_interval:
    yield bytes_read
    last_progress_time = current_time

Impact:
- time.time() is called for every 8MB chunk
- Generator yield adds overhead
- Estimated CPU overhead: 2-3%

---
6. ðŸŸ¢ MINOR: Hash Computation in Main Thread

Location: src/cvv/main.py:568-569

Issue: Hashing done in main read thread

if hasher:
    hasher.update(chunk)  # Holds GIL, blocks read loop

Impact:
- Hashing 8MB takes ~10-20ms (xxHash) or ~50ms (SHA256)
- Blocks next f.read() call
- Estimated throughput loss: 5-15% depending on algorithm

---
Performance Comparison

Current Architecture:

Reader Thread (GIL) â†’ Queue â†’ Writer Thread 1 (GIL)
                    â†˜ Queue â†’ Writer Thread 2 (GIL)
                    â†˜ Queue â†’ Writer Thread 3 (GIL)
                    + Hash (GIL)

Bottleneck: All threads fight for GIL

Optimization Recommendations (Priority Order)

Priority 1: Replace Threading with asyncio or multiprocessing

Option A: asyncio (Best for I/O-bound)
async def _stream_to_destinations_async(self):
    async with aiofiles.open(self.source, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := await f.read(BUFFER_SIZE):
            # Concurrent writes (no GIL contention for I/O)
            await asyncio.gather(*[
                dest_file.write(chunk) for dest_file in dest_files
            ])

Benefits:
- No GIL contention for I/O
- True concurrent writes
- Expected speedup: 2-3x on multi-destination

Option B: multiprocessing (Best for CPU-bound hashing)
# Separate processes for each writer + hasher
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(write_worker, ...) for ...]

Benefits:
- No GIL at all
- Expected speedup: 2-4x with hashing

---
Priority 2: Fix Queue Timeout Issues

# Current: Blocking with timeout
q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # BAD

# Better: Non-blocking with event
q.put(chunk, block=False)  # Immediate
# Or use asyncio.Queue with await

---
Priority 3: Optimize File I/O

# Explicit large buffer matching chunk size
with open(temp_path, 'wb', buffering=BUFFER_SIZE) as f:
    f.write(chunk)

---
Priority 4: Move Hashing to Separate Thread/Process

# Offload hashing to separate thread
hash_queue = queue.Queue()
hash_thread = threading.Thread(target=hash_worker, args=(hash_queue,))

# In main loop
hash_queue.put(chunk)  # Non-blocking

Benchmarking Questions

Before optimizing, I need to understand your current performance:

1. What speeds are you currently seeing? (e.g., 500 MB/s, 1 GB/s)
2. What's your hardware setup?
  - Storage type (NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, network)?
  - Number of destinations typically used?
3. What's your theoretical maximum?
  - Single device sequential write speed?
4. Do you see CPU bottleneck or I/O wait?
  - Run with top or iotop during copy

Expected Performance Gains

| Optimization       | Complexity | Expected Gain | When?                      |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| asyncio for I/O    | Medium     | 2-3x          | Multiple fast destinations |
| multiprocessing    | High       | 2-4x          | CPU-bound (hashing)        |
| Fix queue timeouts | Low        | 10-20%        | Always                     |
| Optimize buffering | Low        | 5-10%         | Always                     |
| Parallel hashing   | Medium     | 10-15%        | With verification          |

The Big Picture

Current bottleneck: You're using Python threading (GIL-bound) for I/O operations (should be async).

Root cause: CPython's GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even for I/O.

Solution: Use asyncio (no GIL for I/O) or multiprocessing (no GIL at all).

Would you like me to implement one of these optimizations? I recommend starting with asyncio as it's the best fit for your I/O-heavy workload.
