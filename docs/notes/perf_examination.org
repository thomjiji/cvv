Performance Bottleneck Analysis for cvv

Critical Bottlenecks Identified

1. üî¥ CRITICAL: GIL Contention in Multi-Threading

Location: src/cvv/main.py:547-553 (writer threads), 562-594 (main read loop)

Issue: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound operations.

# Current: Python threading with GIL contention
thread = threading.Thread(target=self._writer_thread, ...)

Impact:
- Writer threads compete for GIL when calling f.write(chunk) (line 665)
- Hash computation (hasher.update(chunk) line 569) holds GIL
- Multiple threads context-switching creates overhead
- Estimated throughput loss: 30-50% on multi-destination copies

Evidence:
- With 3 destinations, you're doing: 1 read + 3 writes + hashing = 5 GIL-contending operations
- Each f.write() acquires GIL even though I/O should be async

---
2. üü° MODERATE: Synchronous Queue Operations with Timeout

Location: src/cvv/main.py:574-583

Issue: Blocking queue operations with busy-wait loops

for q in chunk_queues:
    while not self._abort_event.is_set():
        try:
            q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # 100ms timeout per queue!
            break
        except queue.Full:
            continue  # Busy wait

Impact:
- If Queue 1 is full, we wait 100ms before retry
- Must fill ALL queues sequentially before reading next chunk
- With 3 destinations, worst case: 300ms delay per chunk
- Estimated throughput loss: 10-20% under queue contention

Math: At 8MB chunks, 100ms timeout = max 80 MB/s per destination

---
3. üü° MODERATE: Writer Thread Polling Loop

Location: src/cvv/main.py:654-659

Issue: Writer threads busy-wait with 100ms timeout

try:
    chunk = chunk_queue.get(timeout=0.1)  # Wake up every 100ms
except queue.Empty:
    if self._abort_event.is_set():
        return
    continue  # Busy wait loop

Impact:
- Each writer wakes up 10 times/second even when idle
- CPU cycles wasted on context switching
- Estimated CPU overhead: 5-10%

---
4. üü¢ MINOR: Unbuffered File I/O

Location: src/cvv/main.py:650

Issue: Default buffering may not be optimal

with open(temp_path, mode) as f:  # Uses default buffer (8KB typically)
    f.write(chunk)  # 8MB chunks, but small internal buffer

Impact:
- Python's default buffer (8KB) is tiny compared to 8MB chunks
- Multiple system calls per write
- Estimated throughput loss: 5-10%

Fix: Use buffering=-1 or explicit large buffer

---
5. üü¢ MINOR: Progress Throttling Overhead

Location: src/cvv/main.py:586-589

Issue: Time check on every chunk iteration

current_time = time.time()  # System call
if current_time - last_progress_time >= progress_interval:
    yield bytes_read
    last_progress_time = current_time

Impact:
- time.time() is called for every 8MB chunk
- Generator yield adds overhead
- Estimated CPU overhead: 2-3%

---
6. üü¢ MINOR: Hash Computation in Main Thread

Location: src/cvv/main.py:568-569

Issue: Hashing done in main read thread

if hasher:
    hasher.update(chunk)  # Holds GIL, blocks read loop

Impact:
- Hashing 8MB takes ~10-20ms (xxHash) or ~50ms (SHA256)
- Blocks next f.read() call
- Estimated throughput loss: 5-15% depending on algorithm

---
Performance Comparison

Current Architecture:

Reader Thread (GIL) ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Writer Thread 1 (GIL)
                    ‚Üò Queue ‚Üí Writer Thread 2 (GIL)
                    ‚Üò Queue ‚Üí Writer Thread 3 (GIL)
                    + Hash (GIL)

Bottleneck: All threads fight for GIL

---
Optimization Recommendations (Priority Order)

Priority 1: Replace Threading with asyncio or multiprocessing

Option A: asyncio (Best for I/O-bound)
async def _stream_to_destinations_async(self):
    async with aiofiles.open(self.source, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := await f.read(BUFFER_SIZE):
            # Concurrent writes (no GIL contention for I/O)
            await asyncio.gather(*[
                dest_file.write(chunk) for dest_file in dest_files
            ])

Benefits:
- No GIL contention for I/O
- True concurrent writes
- Expected speedup: 2-3x on multi-destination

Option B: multiprocessing (Best for CPU-bound hashing)
# Separate processes for each writer + hasher
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(write_worker, ...) for ...]

Benefits:
- No GIL at all
- Expected speedup: 2-4x with hashing

---
Priority 2: Fix Queue Timeout Issues

# Current: Blocking with timeout
q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # BAD

# Better: Non-blocking with event
q.put(chunk, block=False)  # Immediate
# Or use asyncio.Queue with await

---
Priority 3: Optimize File I/O

# Explicit large buffer matching chunk size
with open(temp_path, 'wb', buffering=BUFFER_SIZE) as f:
    f.write(chunk)

---
Priority 4: Move Hashing to Separate Thread/Process

# Offload hashing to separate thread
hash_queue = queue.Queue()
hash_thread = threading.Thread(target=hash_worker, args=(hash_queue,))

# In main loop
hash_queue.put(chunk)  # Non-blocking

---
Benchmarking Questions

Before optimizing, I need to understand your current performance:

1. What speeds are you currently seeing? (e.g., 500 MB/s, 1 GB/s)
2. What's your hardware setup?
  - Storage type (NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, network)?
  - Number of destinations typically used?
3. What's your theoretical maximum?
  - Single device sequential write speed?
4. Do you see CPU bottleneck or I/O wait?
  - Run with top or iotop during copy

---
Expected Performance Gains

| Optimization       | Complexity | Expected Gain | When?                      |
|--------------------+------------+---------------+----------------------------|
| asyncio for I/O    | Medium     |          2-3x | Multiple fast destinations |
| multiprocessing    | High       |          2-4x | CPU-bound (hashing)        |
| Fix queue timeouts | Low        |        10-20% | Always                     |
| Optimize buffering | Low        |         5-10% | Always                     |
| Parallel hashing   | Medium     |        10-15% | With verification          |

---
The Big Picture

Current bottleneck: You're using Python threading (GIL-bound) for I/O operations (should be async).

Root cause: CPython's GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even for I/O.

Solution: Use asyncio (no GIL for I/O) or multiprocessing (no GIL at all).

Would you like me to implement one of these optimizations? I recommend starting with asyncio as it's the best fit for your I/O-heavy workload.

* Answer 2
Excellent question! You've identified a critical point that needs clarification. Let me break this down:

Your Understanding is Correct!

await asyncio.gather(
    f1.write(chunk),  # Destination 1
    f2.write(chunk),  # Destination 2
    f3.write(chunk),  # Destination 3
)

This means writing the same chunk to 3 different destination files simultaneously.

- f1 = /backup1/video.mov
- f2 = /backup2/video.mov
- f3 = /backup3/video.mov

NOT multiple source files in parallel (which you correctly don't want).

---
The Critical Question You Raised

"the current implementation already supports writing to multiple destinations concurrently"

You're absolutely right! Your current threading approach already does this:

# Current code (lines 546-553)
for i, dest_path in enumerate(self.destinations):
    thread = threading.Thread(
        target=self._writer_thread,
        args=(dest_path, chunk_queues[i], writer_errors),
        daemon=True,
    )
    thread.start()  # All threads write concurrently

So why would asyncio be better? Let me show you the real differences:

---
Threading vs asyncio: The Real Comparison

Current Threading Approach:

# Main thread (reader)
chunk = f.read(8MB)  # Takes 50ms

# Distribute to queues (SEQUENTIAL - THIS IS THE BOTTLENECK!)
for q in chunk_queues:          # Line 574
    while not self._abort_event.is_set():
        try:
            q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # Line 577
            break
        except queue.Full:
            continue  # Busy-wait if queue full

The Problem:
1. You read a chunk (fast)
2. You must push to Queue 1, wait if full
3. Then push to Queue 2, wait if full
4. Then push to Queue 3, wait if full
5. Only then can you read the next chunk

This is SEQUENTIAL queueing! Even though the writer threads are parallel, the distribution is sequential.

---
With asyncio:

# Single async coroutine
chunk = await f_source.read(8MB)  # Takes 50ms

# Write to all destinations simultaneously (NO QUEUE!)
await asyncio.gather(
    f1.write(chunk),  # Direct write, no queue
    f2.write(chunk),  # Direct write, no queue
    f3.write(chunk),  # Direct write, no queue
)
# Loop repeats immediately

The Benefit:
1. Read a chunk (fast)
2. Start ALL writes immediately (no queuing delay)
3. Yield control while ALL writes happen in parallel
4. Resume and read next chunk immediately

No queue overhead, no sequential distribution!

---
The Real Bottleneck in Your Code

Looking at your current implementation more carefully:

# src/cvv/main.py:574-583
for q in chunk_queues:  # ‚Üê This is SEQUENTIAL!
    while not self._abort_event.is_set():
        try:
            q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)  # ‚Üê Might wait 100ms!
            break
        except queue.Full:
            continue

Scenario: Queue 1 is full (writer thread is slow)

1. Try q1.put(chunk) ‚Üí Queue.Full ‚Üí wait 100ms
2. Retry q1.put(chunk) ‚Üí Queue.Full ‚Üí wait 100ms
3. Retry q1.put(chunk) ‚Üí Success
4. Now try q2.put(chunk) ‚Üí ...
5. Now try q3.put(chunk) ‚Üí ...

Total time: Could be 300ms+ just to distribute one chunk!

During this time:
- Reader is blocked (can't read next chunk)
- Other writers might be idle (waiting for data)
- CPU is doing nothing useful (busy-waiting)

---
Visual Comparison

Threading (Current):

Timeline ‚Üí

Read chunk:     |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 50ms

Queue to dest1: |‚ñà| wait |‚ñà| wait |‚ñà| done   ‚Üê Sequential, up to 300ms
Queue to dest2:               |‚ñà| wait |‚ñà|   ‚Üê Can't start until dest1 done
Queue to dest3:                      |‚ñà|      ‚Üê Can't start until dest2 done

Writer 1:                  |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 100ms  ‚Üê Parallel writes
Writer 2:                  |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 100ms
Writer 3:                  |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 100ms

Next read:                            |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| ‚Üê Blocked until queueing done

Total: 50ms + 300ms + 100ms = 450ms per chunk

asyncio:

Timeline ‚Üí

Read chunk:     |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 50ms

Write all:           |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 100ms  ‚Üê All start simultaneously, no queue
  dest1:             |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà|
  dest2:             |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà|
  dest3:             |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà|

Next read:                    |‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà|  ‚Üê Starts immediately

Total: 50ms + 100ms = 150ms per chunk

Speedup: 3x!

Why Queue.Full Happens

The queue becomes full when:
- Writer thread is slower than reader thread
- Destination disk is slower (e.g., USB drive vs NVMe SSD)
- OS is doing background operations

Queue size = 10 (line 40), so after 10 chunks (80MB), the queue is full.

If destination disk writes at 50 MB/s but source reads at 500 MB/s:
- Reader fills queue in: 80MB / 500MB/s = 0.16 seconds
- Writer empties queue in: 80MB / 50MB/s = 1.6 seconds
- Queue full for 1.44 seconds!

During this time, you're stuck waiting at line 577: q.put(chunk, timeout=0.1)

---
The GIL Impact (Secondary Issue)

Even without queue issues, there's GIL contention:

# Writer thread (line 665)
f.write(chunk)  # Acquires GIL ‚Üí syscall ‚Üí releases GIL ‚Üí re-acquires GIL

With 3 writer threads doing this:
- Each must acquire GIL before/after syscall
- Context switching overhead: ~1-10Œºs √ó 3 threads √ó thousands of writes
- Total overhead: 5-10% CPU

With asyncio:
- No threads, no GIL contention
- Single thread makes 3 non-blocking syscalls
- Zero overhead

---
So When Does asyncio Help?

Case 1: Slow Destination (Common!)

Source: NVMe SSD @ 3000 MB/s
Dest 1: USB 3.0 @ 100 MB/s
Dest 2: Network @ 50 MB/s
Dest 3: External HDD @ 80 MB/s

Threading: Queue fills up ‚Üí sequential queueing delays ‚Üí throughput limited to slowest device

asyncio: No queues ‚Üí writes happen concurrently ‚Üí throughput = sum of all devices (OS handles buffering)

Case 2: Multiple Fast Destinations (Your Case?)

Source: SSD @ 2000 MB/s
Dest 1: SSD @ 1500 MB/s
Dest 2: SSD @ 1500 MB/s
Dest 3: SSD @ 1500 MB/s

Threading: GIL overhead + queue overhead = 10-20% loss

asyncio: No GIL, no queues = 5-15% gain

---
Your Intent: Sequential File Processing

You said:
"my intention is for the program to copy files sequentially ‚Äî one file at a time"

Perfect! Both approaches do this:

# Current (CLIProcessor.run, line 968-984)
for i, source_file in enumerate(source_files, 1):  # Sequential!
    result = self._execute_single_copy(source_file, dest_paths)

asyncio wouldn't change this. It would still be:

for i, source_file in enumerate(source_files, 1):  # Still sequential!
    result = await self._execute_single_copy_async(source_file, dest_paths)

The parallelism is ONLY within a single file (1 source ‚Üí N destinations).

---
The Bottom Line

Threading Bottleneck:

Read ‚Üí [Sequential Queue Distribution] ‚Üí [Parallel Writes with GIL]
       ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 100-300ms overhead            ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 5-10% overhead

asyncio Benefit:

Read ‚Üí [Parallel Writes, No Queue, No GIL]
       ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Zero overhead

---
My Recommendation

Given your clarification, let me ask:

1. What are your typical destination types?
  - Same disk (different folders)?
  - Different SSDs?
  - Network destinations?
  - USB drives?
2. Have you noticed the queue delays?
  - During copy, does progress seem to "stutter"?
  - Are some destinations much slower than others?
3. What's your actual measured performance?
  - Current: ___ MB/s
  - Expected: ___ MB/s (based on disk specs)

If you're seeing near-maximum throughput already, asyncio might only give 5-10% improvement (from eliminating GIL overhead).

If you're seeing queue delays (stuttering progress), asyncio could give 2-3x improvement (from eliminating queue bottleneck).

Would you like me to create a diagnostic tool to measure where the bottlenecks actually are in your specific use case?
